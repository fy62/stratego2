This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Stratego v2
I made an extremely basic version of Stratego when I had just learned Javascript
and knew nothing of css.  It used sockets, only supported 2 people playing, and
looked like a site from the 90s.  The only thing I remain proud of is the game
logic. With what I know now, my aim is take that logic and put it into a more
polished app.

### Technologies
